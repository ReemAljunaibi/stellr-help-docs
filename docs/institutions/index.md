## 🧠 Engagement Stages & Scoring

Each institution moves through stages of engagement:

1. **Introduction**  
2. **Qualification**  
3. **Collaboration**  
4. **Evolution**

For each stage, users can **submit a scorecard**. This helps track how aligned and valuable each relationship is.

### 📝 Scorecard Criteria (per stage):

- Themes alignment
- Priority relevance
- Source of introduction
- Legal structure clarity
- Brand alignment
- Leadership connection
- Other partners

Each item is rated on a scale of **1 to 5**.

## 💡 Tips for Users

- Only **admins** can approve institutions. If you're not seeing your entry in the approved list, it may be pending review.
- Use **filters** to narrow down large datasets — e.g., show only institutions in the “Collaboration” stage.
- To maintain clarity, ensure each institution is only added **once** to avoid duplicates.
- When scoring, **select the correct stage first**, then submit your evaluation — this ensures accurate tracking over time.
